# Hands-on Labs for Modern Application Development

This workshop aims to showcase how to modernize applications for solving the challenges faced by existing applications in the current landscape as below:

* **Integration**: Challenging to leverage new cloud based services
* **Scalability**: Not able to meet web scale due to data-centric architecture
* **Reliability**: Unable to quickly deploy new capabilities
* **Developer productivity and Business Agility**: Often low in comparison to cloud native applications

Take a look at the [Konveyor Community’s Application Modernization Report for 2022](https://www.konveyor.io/modernization-report/) to understand how users and organizations define application modernization as well as top reasons for modernization.

## Key Takeaways

* Modernization has a broad spectrum of definitions, but containerizing and automation rank high. 
* The containerizing is a broad enough trend to encompass multiple strategies including refactoring with Microservices. 
* Increasing scalability and reliability are key reasons for modernization.

## Technology Stack

* Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
* Red Hat Runtimes (Quarkus, Spring Boot, Node.js, Tomcat)
* Red Hat OpenShift (Pipeline, GitOps, Virtualization)
* Oracle Database and PostgreSQL
