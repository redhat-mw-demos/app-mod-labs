= 2. Assessment - 25 minutes

== Goals of this lab

As part of the `Globex`’ digital transformation and cloud adoption initiative, the development and devops teams embarked upon a journey to modernize their existing siloed services running on the virtual machines on Red Hat Virtualization and containerized applications on Red Hat OpenShift separately.

The goal is to assess the siloed current application portfolio and identify potential issues and risks to implement advanced cloud native architecture with the application modernization.

== 2.1. Access the Tackle Web Console

To start the assessment of the existing applications we will use the https://www.konveyor.io/tools/tackle[Tackle^] Application Assessment tool in the https://www.konveyor.io[Konveyor^] community to move our applications. We will use _Tackle_ to assess the `Customers` service based on the _Tomcat_ server on Red Hat Virtualization.

Open a new browser to access the Tackle web console that is provided from the *shared environment detail page*. Use the following credential.

* Username or email: `tackle`
* Password: `password`

You will see existing application inventories such as *Customers*, *Orders*, and *RetailFrontend*.

**Tackle Application Inventory** is the vehicle which selects applications for assessment by https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-pathfinder[Pathfinder^] and analysis by https://github.com/windup/[windup^]. It provides users four main functions:

* Maintain a portfolio of applications.
* Link applications to the business services they support.
* Define interdependencies.
* Add metadata using an extensible tagging model to describe and categorize applications in multiple dimensions.

**Tackle Pathfinder** is an interactive questionnaire based tool that assesses the suitability of applications for modernization in order to deploy them into containers on an enterprise Kubernetes platform. The tool output includes:

* Application’s suitability for Kubernetes
* Associated risks
* Adoption plan with the applications’ prioritization, business criticality and dependencies.

== 2.2. Controls

https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-controls[Tackle Controls^] are a collection of entities that add value to Application Inventory and the Pathfinder assessment. They comprise _business services_, _stakeholders_, _stakeholder groups_, _job functions_, _tag types_, and _tags_.

=== 2.2.1. Stakeholders

Go to `Controls` on the left menu and you will existing _stakeholders_ such as *Hank Scorpio* and *Homer Simpson*.

image::../images/tackle-control-stakeholder.png[stakeholders]

You can also find the existing _stakeholder groups_ such as *IT Management* and *Retail Management* for the application assessment.

image::../images/stakeholder-groups.png[stakeholder-groups]

=== 2.2.2. Business services

Applications can be classified and grouped in multiple ways such as **business service**. We've created a business service for the legacy `Retail` applications.

Go to `Controls` on the left menu and click on _Business services_ tab. You will see existing _business services_ such as *Finance and HR* and *Retail*.

== 2.3. Application inventory

Let’s focus on the legacy application. We have added tags that represent its technology, like java, Tomcat and Oracle, and decided to add a custom tag type that allows us to identify which custom architecture libraries are used by each application.

=== 2.3.1. Update the Customers Application Inventory

Go to `Application inventory` on the left menu and click on `pencil` icon for the customers inventory.

image::../images/app-inventory-landing.png[app-inventory-landing]

Fill in the following fields. Then, click on `Save`.

[NOTE]
====
Do not press the `enter` key. It will save and close the application inventory automatically.
====

* Business service: `Retail`
* Tags: `Java`, `Tomcat`, `RHEL 8`, `Oracle`

=== 2.3.2. Re-Access the Legacy Customers Application

The assessment is driven by multiple `questionnaires` and aims to determine the suitability for containerization for a given application. It covers all the different areas of the *application landscape*, including the *technology*, *application lifecycle management*, and *operations*. These questionnaires allow the tool to identify potential risks that might prevent the application from running in containers or would require any kind of adjustment for that.

Since the legacy application comes from a traditional platform, we already have assessed the retail services to identify technical problems a while back. However, we couldn't answer the configuration model during the first assessment by the SRE team. So we just left the answer as `Unknown` at that time.

Today, you'll run the *second* assessment to choose the proper answer in the `cross-cutting concerns` section for the _customers_ application. 

Click on `Assess`.

image::../images/app-inventory-access.png[app-inventory-access]

When you see *This application has already been assessed. Do you want to continue?* message, click on `Continue` to make sure to proceed the assessment once again.

First step will be to select the stakeholders (_e.g. Homer Simpson_) involved with the assessment. Leave the default values.

image::../images/select-stakeholder.png[select-stakeholder]

Click on `Next`.

[NOTE]
====
Take a look how the former answers were chosen in the initial assessment for each application assessment section such as `Details`, `Dependencies`, and `Observability`. You don't need to change any answers but keep clicking on `Next` button until you get into the `Application cross-cutting concerns` section.

=== 2.3.3. Application cross-cutting concerns

Choose the following answer for the *How is the application configured?* question. The SRE team finally figured out that the customers application currently refers to multiple configurations in the separated file systems. 

* *Question* - How is the application configured?
* *Answer* - `Multiple configuration files in multiple file system locations`

Click on `Save and review`.

== 2.4. Application Review

You will be presented with the review screen. It allows you to find out which risks were identified during the assessment and decide which migration strategy to follow based on that.

image::../images/review.png[review]

Scroll down the screen to view the risks. This legacy application uses a discovery mechanism that is not cloud-friendly, which makes sense since it comes from a classic platform and accesses a database through a static IP.

image::../images/review-high-risk.png[review-high-risk]

Now that you know there will be some changes required in the source code to adapt the application, we can decide that the strategy will be `Refactor`.

* Proposed action: `Refactor`
* Effort estimate: `Small`

Since this is a key application in the architecture, we’re going to set the criticality and priority to `10`.

* Business criticality: `10`
* Work priority: `9`

Click on `Submit Review`. 

image::../images/submit-review.png[submit-review]

Now that you have completed the `2nd assessment` to update the `Application cross-cutting concerns` section. You have also identified a new `high` risk along with the external configuration references and dependencies.

image::../images/complete-review.png[complete-review]

Go to `Report` on the left menu. Then filter the report by `Retail` business service and you will find out the report details such as _Current landscape_, _Suggested adoption plan_, and _Identified risks_.
